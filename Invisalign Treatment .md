Is Invisalign Right For You? Our Dublin Metro Dental Cosmetic Dentist Helps you to Decide
If you are among many people who wants to enhance their smile, but is turned off with the idea of metal braces then Invisalign may be for you. Invisalign Treatment is a comfortable, easy-to-use alternative to conventional orthodontic therapy. Our Dublin Metro Dental Invisalign dentist have put together this brief overview that will help you discover if you may have the ability to benefit from this treatment.

Invisalign uses a series of clear plastic aligners, instead of metal brackets and wires, to slowly straighten teeth. Broadly , Invisalign can perform everything that traditional braces may perform; the exception being cases where the patient should fix extreme structural issues.


Invisalign might be right for you if you want to:

Close gaps between teeth

Straighten a crooked smile

Fix bite problems, like crossbites, overbites, and underbites

Make your smile wider, so that it fills more of the visual space in your mouth when you smile

A lot of people choose Invisalign Treatment since they wish to enhance dental alignment without drawing attention to the fact that they are experiencing therapy. Since Invisalign aligners are made of clear plastic resin, they are nearly undetectable once in place over a patient’s teeth. The aesthetics of Invisalign are much superior to the visual effect of standard braces.

Another reason you may turn to Invisalign is since this therapy permits you to easily keep a fresh and clean smile. You’ll actually take your aligners out when it is time to brush or floss your teeth, so you don’t have to be concerned about the plaque buildup associated with brackets and wires.

When you meet with our Dublin Ohio Invisalign Dentists, we’ll assess your smile, and help you determine whether Invisalign Treatment can help you reach your dental goals. There’s truly no reason to continue living with a smile that you don’t’ love, so give us a call to get started!
